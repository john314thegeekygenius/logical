-- Logical - A digital logic simulator for HTML written in Javascript (yuck) 

Please don't use this. It's not any good yet, and I don't think I'll ever finish it.

But if you really want, install npm and host it with `http-server` or somthing idk.

Why would you use a logic simulator written in Javascript for cry'in out loud!?!

Use somthing written in a real mans language like php!
